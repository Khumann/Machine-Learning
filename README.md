# Practicing ML cocepts
###  1. Baye's Classifier from scratch 
###  2. Fair ML metric 
(hands-on experience with various fairness metrics used to evaluate the fairness of machine learning models, Investigate insights into the fairness of data-driven decision-making algorithms, Critically appraise the use and limitations of different fairness metrics.)
###  3.Global Explanation Black box model 
 ( This file  will introduce methods for explaining black-box models and provide hands-on experience in creating and analyzing both black-box and explainable models. The goal is to predict an outcome and reflect on the performance of these models while investigating how their predictions can be explained.) 
###  4. K-means
###  5. Linear Regression, PCA and LDA
###  6. Local Black Box Explanation 
 ( This project focuses on implementing and utilizing the Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE) method to explain the decisions of a complex pre-trained machine learning (ML) model used for object labeling in images. RISE is a local explanation technique that helps understand which parts of an input image contribute to the model's predictions, no external libraries are used for this method.)
###  7. SVM, NN & CNN
